        It's the first personnal game project I have started (work in progress).
        The "why" of this project is beacause I want to learn how a game is made, on every aspect and exeperience it myself.
        
        For this project I have 3 objectives. <br>
        First is designing, modeling, riging two characters.
        Second is making a demo level (primary mechanics, setting the mood, introducing the game to see if people like it).
        Third is making a complete game.

        For now I am working on the game design especially the story and characters design.

        I did a game jam in IUT
        It was a game, I did with a team of 6, during **30 hours** with [Godot Engine 4](https://godotengine.org/).
        In this project, I was in charge of the game design, especially in the game mechanics and formulas.

        The goal is to set a record, the score is calculated with the time you survive. You survive by dodging ennemies, picking up power-ups.
        The longer you survive the faster are the ennemies, the music rythm, animations and player speed.

        It was a project in pair of 2. Where we create a 2D game with SDL library.
        The goal was to collect all coins in the level without being hit by the monsters.

        It was a project I did with a team of 4 people.
        A classmate and I were in charge of making a software, mobile app to be more precise,
        that would allowed the user to claim a locker in the school and open it with a QR code.
        The QR code would be generated by the app. After some researches to find a software
        that would be efficient and easy to use, we selected FlutterFlow.
        We used it and the screenshot is the storyboard / navigation flow of the pages we made.

        It was a project in a group of 4 people. Where we design, develop and test an administration software.

        During this project, we first made a storyboard of the software, then we made a prototype with Figma.
        Then we made a UML diagram to show the architecture of the software.
        After that we start the development with Java and JavaSwing (and a bit of awt), using the MVC pattern.
        And then we tested the software with JUnit tests.
        Finally we test by ourselves and by external people to see if the software is easy to use and if it works as expected.

        note : The screenshot is the Figma prototype of the software. The actual software looks more like a 2000s software.

        It was a project in a trio. The goal of the project was to make us work on the ability to understand a client request.
        To reach this goal, we wrote questions to ask a librarian about his needs for a web site.
        We also analyse the existing web site of his library and ones of other libraries.
        Then we wrote a report of our analysis.

        This project was in a quatuor. The goal was to set up a network of computers and make them communicate with each other.
        We had to set up a bunch of routers, computers, DHCP servers and DNS servers. We also had to set up a router by using SSH connection.

        This project was in two parts. The first part was in solo, where I had to create a data base with PL/SQL using Oracle SQL Developer.
        The second part was in trio, where we were in the roles of analysts and had to use pyhton to extract data from the database and display them in a dashboard.
