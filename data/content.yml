        It's the first personnal game project I have started (work in progress).
        The "why" of this project is beacause I want to learn how a game is made, on every aspect and exeperience it myself.
        
        For this project I have 3 objectives. <br>
        First is designing, modeling, riging two characters.
        Second is making a demo level (primary mechanics, setting the mood, introducing the game to see if people like it).
        Third is making a complete game.

        For now I am working on the game design especially the story and characters design.

        I did a game jam in IUT in 2025.
        It was a game, I did with a team of 6, during **30 hours** with [Godot Engine 4](https://godotengine.org/).
        In this project, I was in charge of the game design, especially in the game mechanics and formulas.

        The goal is to set a record, the score is calculated with the time you survive. You survive by dodging ennemies, picking up power-ups.
        The longer you survive the faster are the ennemies, the music rythm, animations and player speed.

        It was a project in pair of 2. Where we create a 2D game with SDL library.
        The goal was to collect all coins in the level without being hit by the monsters.

        It was a project I did with a team of 4 people.
        A classmate and I were in charge of making a software, mobile app to be more precise,
        that would allowed the user to claim a locker in the school and open it with a QR code.
        The QR code would be generated by the app. After some researches to find a software
        that would be efficient and easy to use, we selected FlutterFlow.
        We used it and the screenshot is the storyboard / navigation flow of the pages we made.
